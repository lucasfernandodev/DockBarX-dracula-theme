## Deep dock theme made from a background png by BigRZA

## Rows that begins with # are comments
## Change the name if you make a new style
name=Dracula

## To add a background picture to the style simply add a file
## named background.png to the arcive. The picture is automaticly
## tiled to fill the popup. If the picture has transparency it can
## be used together with gradients and the background color. 
## Keep the file as small as possible.

## Remove the # in front of a setting to start using it.
## All the commented options in this file has the default value.

## The background color for  the dock
## Alpha goes from 0 (completely transparent) to 100 (completely opaque)
## Remember that this alpha always is 100 if a non-composited window manager is used.
bg_color="#282a36"
bg_alpha=100


## Thickness of the border (in pixels)
border_width=0.4

## The color for the border of the popup
border_color="#44475a"

## The percentual size of the dock compared to the group button size.
## (The size given in the the dock preference is group button size.)
#rel_size=100

## The radius of the corner roundness (in pixels).
#roundness=6

## The amount of pixels on the sides of the group buttons
## This number includes the border.
#side_padding=6


## Slope tells how steep the corners of the dock will be.
## It's given in degrees. 90 gives a straigt corner,
## higher numbers will make an inwards slope and lower an outwards slope.
## Dont go too close to 0 or 180 otherwice you'll make an dock that takes up 
## way too much sceen real estate. It's pretty much trial and error to get
## something that looks right.
#slope=90

## Bend will bend the slope towards the screen edge. 0 means no bend and
## 100 means maximum bend. A big bend will make the slope look closer to
## 90 than it really is so you'll probably have to play with both numbers
## until you find what you are looking for.
#bend=0

## Linear gradients
## You can use up to three linear gradients at once. Just copy-paste and
## change thenumber at the end of gradient to 2 or 3 to set the options for
## the second or third gradient.
## To use a linear gradient, just set use_linear_gradient to 1.
#use_linear_gradient1=0

## The angle sets the direction of the linear gradient in degrees.
## For a bottom dock, an angle of 0 will go from left to right, 
## 180 will go from right to left, 90 will go from bottom to top 
## and -90 from top to bottom. 
#linear_gradient1_angle=0

## Start and stop values tells at what point the gradient the gradient will start
## and stop. To make it work more or less the same no matter the size and ratio 
## of the dock, it's counted along one of the diagonals of the dock,
## which one depends on the angle. 
## If for example the start value is set to 25 and stop to 90,it means 
## that along the first 25 % of the diagonal only the start color will be shown. 
## After that the gradient will start to blend into the stop color and after
## 90 % of the the diagonal only stop color will be shown.
#linear_gradient1_start=0
#linear_gradient1_start_color="#44475a"
#linear_gradient1_start_alpha=20
#linear_gradient1_stop=100
#linear_gradient1_stop_color="#44475a"
#linear_gradient1_stop_alpha=0

## If the background image should be streched according to the height of the dock 
## set strech_bg_img to 1.
strech_bg_img=1



## A second bar can be placed upon the first bar. 
##To use the second bar, use_bar2 needs to be set to 1.
#use_bar2=0

## The second bar can either be overlayed over the first so that you can
## see the first bar underneath as long as the second bar isn't completely
## opacue. Alternatively the second bar can replace the first bar when they
## overlap. This is the default option. Change it by setting bar_type to "layer".
#bar2_type=replace

## Pretty much all commands commands mentioned above can be
## used for the second bar. Just add the prefix "bar2_" to them. 

#bar2_bg_color="#ff0000"
#bar2_bg_alpha=50
#bar2_border_width=0.8
#bar2_border_color="#000000"
#bar2_rel_size=100
#bar2_roundness=6
#bar2_side_padding=6
#bar2_slope=90
